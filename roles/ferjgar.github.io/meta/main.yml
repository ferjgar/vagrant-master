# hate to add a dependency, but installing ruby is not trivial at all on unix (WHY?)
# RVM does a lot of black magic, so let's use its official role to KISS
# note that this role must be installed BEFORE executing this playbook, can't be done at runtime
# because ansible will fail if not found, that's why we have requirements.yml, which will be used
# by vagrant to do just that
dependencies:
  - { role: rvm.ruby,
        rvm1_rubies: ['ruby-2.3.1'],
        # we need the lines below to install ruby and related stuff system-wide
        rvm1_install_flags: '--auto-dotfiles',
        rvm1_install_path: /usr/local/rvm,
        rvm1_user: root
    }
